# Hana
An invite checking bot for apms!

Hana is an invite checking bot for apms to be utilized to check for invalid invites during or for a mass. It can help you to see whether the invite's valid so you don't have to post invalid links! It is coded to perform like the previous Sakura that Flare#2851 has coded. 

Check out the newest version of Sakura that Flare has coded [here](https://github.com/Chiitoi/Sakura/)!
